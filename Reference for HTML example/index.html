  	<!-- This is how you can grab an image.
  	 
  	 "img src=" is telling the computer you want an "img" or "image" and the "src=" or "source" is telling the computer where we are getting the image from.
	
	 Inside the quotation is where we put the URL/link/path to the image.

	 "alt" refers to the name of the image. This is something we define (so in this example we called it "A dino")

	 "height" and "width" refers to the dimension of the image (so you can make it bigger or smaller depending on what you want)

  	-->
