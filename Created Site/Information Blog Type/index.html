				<!-- Description about the Aurora Borealis or Australis -->
				<p>
					Seen in both polar regions of the planet, this dazzling light show is aptly referred to as the Northern or Southern Lights. Unlike most of the entries on this list, you can view an aurora from many different locations around the world; the higher the latitude, the more likely you are to see them. While most of the Natural Wonders of the World play out on land or at sea, aurora are an unforgettable sight that can only be witnessed by looking to the skies. The effect is brought on by charged cosmic particles entering and interacting with the Earth's atmosphere, causing vivid colors to be painted across the night sky. Humans have speculated about the cause of this night-time display of color endlessly for centuries, with references to the lights being found in texts from Ancient Greece, in stories from Norse Mythology, and sources from Medieval England.

				<!-- Description about the Victoria Falls -->
				<p>
					As the Zambezi River crosses the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe, its waters descend 355 feet (108 metres) down the astonishing Victoria Falls. The waterfall was named in 1855 for the reigning English monarch, Queen Victoria, by Scottish explorer David Livingstone during his famous journey across Africa. The indigenous name Mosi-oa-Tunya – or The Smoke that Thunders – is still in use locally, and in 2013 the government of Zimbabwe announced plans to officially rename the falls as such. Victoria Falls isn't the highest or the broadest waterfall on the planet, but when taking both attributes into consideration, it qualifies as the largest. One particular highlight for visitors is the so-called 'Devil's Pool' that typically forms between September and December. The seasonally lowered level of the Zambezi river, combined with a rock barrier, make it possible to swim in a relatively sedate pool mere feet away from the edge of the falls. However, it's far from the safest option; several deaths have been reported in recent years.
